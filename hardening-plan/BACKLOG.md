## ~~Red LED-row flash during/after RGB adjustment~~ — FIXED 2026-09-01 (6ca0102941)

**Resolution:** the driver's own `EFLD1.state != FLASH_PGM` guard skipped
the row ADVANCE during flash programming but left the current mux row
energized, so the masked program windows froze that row at its live colour
slot for the whole multi-ms write (~18x brightness: red one time, green
another). The FLASH_PGM branch now de-selects every mux pin (ISR-safe GPIO
writes; `sn32f2xx_blank()` is NOT ISR-safe under hardware PWM). Verified by
JD: long hue/brightness sweeps AND 15 host-forced EEPROM writes at 1 Hz --
no pops and no perceptible darkening. The
proposed-fix notes below are historical.

**Symptom (historical):** holding an RGB adjust key (e.g. Fn+Up), a row of red LEDs
flashes briefly. Longstanding, cosmetic.

**Root cause (understood, not guessed):** the settled eeconfig write fires
~0.9 s after the values stop moving (RGB_SETTLE_MS). The EFL program window
masks interrupts for its few-ms duration (efl_ramtext.diff -- deliberate,
see the audits), which freezes the LED row mux mid-cycle: whichever hardware
row was energized in its RED time-slot stays lit at full duty until the
write completes. It is the flash write announcing itself.

**Proposed fix:** blank the LED matrix around the program window --
`sn32f2xx_blank()` exists for exactly this (forces every row/col pin
high-Z; created for the stop-the-ISR case, currently zero callers). Call it
from `backing_store_pre_write_hook()` before the write.
**⚠️ The blocker to resolve first:** blank changes pin MODES to high-Z; if
the row ISR only writes levels/duties and never re-initialises pin modes,
the matrix stays dark after the write. Verify whether `rgb_callback` /
the driver's row advance reconfigures modes per cycle, or add an explicit
re-init after the write. Needs a hardware round-trip -- do not ship blind.

## Scan-rate observation

Instrumented builds read ~230-310 Hz (console + probes overhead); the daily
build reads ~375 Hz. Judge scan-rate bands per flavor.

## rx_malformed baseline

The fault suite's byte soup legitimately raises rx_malformed (by ~5 per
run) for the remainder of that boot. Normal-use expectation is 0 growth.

## On-LCD health readout (BT-mode diagnostics)

Raw-HID replies don't come back in BT mode, and flipping the slider to read
them wired POWER-CYCLES the board (see CLAUDE.md), wiping the counters. The
only way to diagnose a BT session is to show the counters ON THE PANEL --
e.g. a magic-key or Fn-combo that paints tx_sent/timeouts/drops/gap into
the text band for a few seconds. Small, uses display_set_param_status-like
plumbing.

## Keystroke-miss hunt (transport-independent)

JD perceives occasional missed keystrokes on BOTH transports; tonight's BT
bursts measured clean (drops 0, coalescing never engaged). Prime suspect:
wear-leveling sector erases blocking the main loop 50-300 ms, rare and
irregular. Protocol: instrumented build + consolelog.sh + normal typing;
the [stall] line attributes any >=4 ms gap to flash/blit/i2c the moment it
happens. Run when it next "feels bad".

## Slider power asymmetry + host-switch key clearing (2026-09-01, Rachel + JD)

Measured: wired->BT does NOT reboot; BT->wired reboots EVERY time (power-
source switchover; direction-asymmetric ride-through). The boot reset cause
is now readable -- HC_CONN reply byte 7 carries raw RSTST. MEASURED
2026-09-01: the BT->cable flip reset is rstst=0x05 (LVD+SW, no POR) --
an LVD BROWNOUT during the power-source switchover. Question CLOSED.

Held-key-across-host-switch: QMK's handle_host_changed() verifiably never
clears report state (Rachel, from source), but the predicted stuck key did
NOT reproduce on macOS. clear_keyboard() now runs before the route flips
anyway (bt_ui_mode_slider). Upstream issue DEFERRED until the consequence
reproduces on some host (try Windows) -- the source-level observation alone
is thin receipts.

## RTC: reflash erases the persisted trim; SECCNTV write costs ~0.5 s phase (2026-09-01)

Measured after the flash marathon: board ~4100-6200 ppm slow, halving per
trim -- RE-CONVERGENCE from the compile-time seed, not a regression. Two
facts to carry: (1) every reflash erases eeconfig incl. the persisted
divider period, so the ~hour-long climb (with 2 s snaps) restarts after
each flash until the first post-10-min trim persists again; (2) per SN32F299
datasheet 12.5.6 (found by the f4 session), writing SECCNTV resets SECCNT,
so each trim discards the elapsed fraction of the current second -- a mean
0.5 s phase loss per trim, later corrected by a snap. Possible improvement:
apply trims only at a second boundary (right after the 1 Hz callback) to
bound the loss to ~0. Also: the ILRC's temperature coefficient means a
fixed RTC_PERIOD_INITIAL can be thousands of ppm off on a different day --
the persisted value is the real seed; the constant is only for fresh EEPROM.
