# Current status — the crash hunt

Updated 2026-09-23, 19:05. The live plan is
[`CRASH-HUNT-PLAN.md`](CRASH-HUNT-PLAN.md); its codex review and every
finding's disposition are linked from it.

## Why

One spontaneous, unexplained watchdog reset on 2026-09-22 at ~13:13
([incident](../history/incident-2026-09-22-wdt/README.md)). The retained
operation breadcrumbs added that afternoon
([WATCHDOG-BREADCRUMBS.md](WATCHDOG-BREADCRUMBS.md)) will name where the main
loop stopped next time. The crash hunt adds what they cannot say (a CPU fault
versus a hang, the PC, stack depth, why blits time out) and tries to provoke
the next reset instead of waiting for it.

## Installed right now (19:00)

- **Firmware: the FINAL DAILY of the 2026-09-23 campaign**,
  `via-daily-44e7314e65-20260923-185609.bin`, token `0xa887132e`, flashed
  18:56. It carries v7 and every fix below:
  - the fault record's lost write;
  - the SPI0 lost completion;
  - the serial and USB lock nesting;
  - the CH582F pump order.

  No test hooks (`HC_PEEK` verified refused).
- **A ten-hour crash hunt is running on it**: 18:56 → ~04:57,
  `~/Library/Logs/ak820pro/crash-hunt/20260923-185647/`, `--pause-agent`, so
  it **restores the agent itself** at the end.
- **When it ends:**
  - if clean, move `deps.lock` to firmware `44e7314e65` and push;
  - archive its evidence to `history/`;
  - hand the keyboard back to the owner, who is on another keyboard
    meanwhile.
- Keymap and lighting: `~/Documents/ak820pro-{keymap,lighting}.json`
  (refreshed by each flash today) match the verified hunt backup of
  2026-09-22 23:00.

## ✅ The DMA "never-start" is solved (2026-09-23)

Every "never started" blit timeout on record was a **completed** transfer
whose completion the SPI0 half-transfer handler erased. It read `RIS` and
then cleared every flag, so a DMATCIF raised between those two instructions
was lost.

Only 660-byte clock digits were exposed, and the reason is timing. The
equal-priority LED row ISR delays that handler until 188–258 µs after the
arm, and a 660-byte transfer completes at 220 µs. The fix (ChibiOS
`c57623d0d2`) clears only what was read and re-checks for the completion.
E5 ran **3 hours and 580,060 blits with no timeout**.

Found with `CURCNT` instrumentation. Along the way, `DMACNT` turned out never
to count down, so "never started" was a label, not a diagnosis. A Codex review
(`gpt-6-astra`, reasoning effort high) supplied the equal-priority
correction. It also found the other fixes of the day:
- the USB lock nesting;
- the CH582F pump order;
- the `IC` read-modify-write.

Full analysis and every disposition:

Evidence:
[`history/crash-hunt-2026-09-23-lost-completion/`](../history/crash-hunt-2026-09-23-lost-completion/).

## ✅ The fault recorder works, after a fix (2026-09-23)

All seven `HC_FAULT` modes were verified on hardware. The first runs of
modes 1 and 3 came back invalid: on this chip **the last SRAM write before a
loop that never writes again is lost at the watchdog reset**, and every
handler commits its record and then spins. So the final `FAULT_MAGIC` store
was lost, every time. `DSB` doesn't help; one sacrificial write after it
does (`commit_terminal()`, firmware `02db293696`). The watchdog also **recovers a
locked-up core** (mode 4), with the record intact. Details:
[`CRASH-HUNT-PLAN.md`](CRASH-HUNT-PLAN.md), "Third result", and
[`docs/hardware.md`](../docs/hardware.md). ⚠️ The v7 daily build lacks the
fix: a fault on it would record as invalid, so a real crash would read
"unavailable".

## ✅ The fix held: ten hours, no reset (second hunt, 23:00 → 09:00)

Same stress that hung v6 in 13 minutes: no reset in 10 h and 1,960,093
blits. The guard caught 7 overlaps, **all 7 alongside a DMA that never
started** -- the predicted mechanism. All 53 blit timeouts were never-starts,
all recovered by one retry. All 8 non-flash stalls ≥ 25 ms (25–26 ms) came
with a never-start recovery. Deepest stack use: interrupt 464/1024, main
680/2048. Settings verified at exit; the agent restored itself at 09:00:15
and is writing v7 rows to `ak820-health.csv`. Evidence:
[`history/crash-hunt-2026-09-23-v7/`](../history/crash-hunt-2026-09-23-v7/).

The first hunt (v6, 21:05) was stopped at 22:03. It ignored `pkill -INT` (a
background job inherits SIGINT as ignored), so it was stopped with SIGTERM
and its settings restored from its backup by hand, verified; the script now
handles both signals. Its evidence is in
[`history/crash-hunt-2026-09-22/`](../history/crash-hunt-2026-09-22/).

**If the keyboard freezes in ordinary use:** leave it connected. The
watchdog brings it back in ~15 s; read `ak820 health --crash` (on v7 a fault
carries its PC: `scripts/symbolize.sh <pc> <token>`). A cold power-off
destroys the record.

## ⚠️ The hunt reproduced the hang at 21:18:52 — and the cause is found

13 minutes in: `lcd_transfer within text`. A synchronous LCD draw re-armed the
flash->LCD DMA while the glyph pump's last transfer was still in flight, which
left SPI0 unable to complete an ordinary `spiSend()`; no timeout, so the
watchdog. Full mechanism and fix in `CRASH-HUNT-PLAN.md` ("First result").
A second codex pass found the same hole in the CPU draws (Caps padlock,
battery fill, icons) and in every external-flash transaction, so the fix is
now `bus_quiesce()` at the start of every CPU transaction on either bus. That
also gives the owner's 13:13 crash (typing, light load) a plausible path. A
narrow third codex pass verified the guard covers every runtime transaction
([review](review-codex-crash-hunt-impl3-2026-09-22.md)). Committed as
firmware `1b7f781887`; flashed 22:59 (see above).

## Health v7 (Part B) — daily flashed 2026-09-22 22:59; validated 2026-09-23

Daily: `ak820pro-builds/out/via-daily-1b7f781887-20260922-225845.*` (flashed
until the 2026-09-23 fault tests; lacks the lost-write fix above). A
HardFault or an unhandled vector now
writes a terminal record with the PC and the interrupted context, and a ChibiOS
halt records its caller. The record's consecutive-reset count clears after 10
healthy minutes, so three spread-out crashes can no longer switch the watchdog
off for good. Page 6 adds stack watermarks, the blit-timeout breakdown and a
build token that `scripts/symbolize.sh` resolves to the archived ELF.
Host simulation passes under ASan/UBSan; the Rust side decodes all of it (364
unit tests). Codex reviewed the implementation twice: no High and twelve
Medium/Low issues the first time
([review-codex-crash-hunt-impl-2026-09-22.md](review-codex-crash-hunt-impl-2026-09-22.md)),
two High (the unguarded bus paths above) and four smaller the second
([review-codex-crash-hunt-impl2-2026-09-22.md](review-codex-crash-hunt-impl2-2026-09-22.md)).
All fixed; the third pass left two small hunt-script fixes, also done. The archived
ELFs now carry line info: `scripts/symbolize.sh <pc> <token>` answers with
file:line.

## Next

1. **When the overnight hunt ends:**
   - check it: 0 timeouts expected;
   - move `deps.lock` to `44e7314e65` and push;
   - archive the run;
   - confirm the agent restored itself.
2. **Open review items**, in [`FIRMWARE-FINDINGS-2026-09-23.md`](FIRMWARE-FINDINGS-2026-09-23.md):
   - rework `lcd_blit_wait()`'s start detection and classification on
     CURCNT/DMAEN;
   - FRESET SPI0 at hand-back;
   - check that internal-flash programming only ever targets erased lines
     (the LLD erases the whole sector otherwise);
   - invalidate display shadows when a glyph is dropped;
   - give the debug-page pump a recovery path;
   - count UART overrun.
3. **SPI0 raw-RIS dispatch:** the patch that tried it was reverted. With the
   lost-completion fix in, a stale DMA flag outside a transfer is unlikely,
   but the routing is still on raw `RIS`.
4. **CH582F ACK deadline (10 ms):** about half of the module's ACKs take
   15–36 ms in wired mode. Measure in Bluetooth mode before changing it.
5. **Stress the untouched paths:** RTC I2C, Mac sleep/wake, and the Mac
   reboot test for the agent.
6. **Parked idea** (taskmaster task 6): a QR code to the agent installer via
   a jqr.ca redirect.

## Repository notes

All pushed, 2026-09-23 ~19:00. Firmware `ak820pro-jdlien` is at `44e7314e65`;
ChibiOS `ak820pro-patches` is at `c212e20dd2`. That branch carries three
fixes from today: the serial fix `a3fdffe26d`, the SPI0 lost completion
`c57623d0d2` and the USB fix `c212e20dd2`. It also carries the reverted
dispatch attempt `2a17a73b48` and its revert `bf9310ca84`.

**`deps.lock` still pins `02db293696`** (v7 plus the lost-write fix). It moves
to `44e7314e65` once the overnight hunt passes. The recovery bundle in
`ak820pro-builds/` holds the new ChibiOS tip. `.taskmaster/` stays untracked, as
before; it now holds task 6, the QR idea. The hunt's raw output stays in
`~/Library/Logs/ak820pro/crash-hunt/`; a snapshot of the 21:18 evidence is in
[`history/crash-hunt-2026-09-22/`](../history/crash-hunt-2026-09-22/).
